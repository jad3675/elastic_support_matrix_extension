# Elastic Support Matrix Enhancer

A Chrome extension that supercharges the official [Elastic Support Matrix](https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix) page, making it interactive, searchable, and easier to navigate.

-   **Powerful Filtering & Searching**:
    -   Instantly search for specific operating systems.

-   **Clean, Modern Interface**: All data is presented in a responsive, full-screen overlay with a clear and readable table layout.
-   **At-a-Glance Statistics**: See key stats like the total number of supported OS versions, what you're currently viewing, and more.
-   **Expandable Details**: Click "View All Versions" to see a complete list of every supported version for a specific OS.
